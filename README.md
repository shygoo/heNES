This emulator is very early in development so there will be a lot of bugs.
No memory mappers are currently implemented so only NROM games are expected to boot properly.
You can view a comprehensive list of games and mappers here: http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/nesmapper.txt
(Games with "---- (0)" under the mapper column are NROMs)
